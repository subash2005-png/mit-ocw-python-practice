# Approximation algorithm:
##   *In this alogorithm,we can't find the exact solution(in some case) but we can able to find the approximation value which is close to the solution.
##   *In guess and check algo,we make an guess if it provides the solution , we stop , otherwise we keep making guessing upto certain limit.
##   *Two parameters of approximation algorithm: 
##        Epsilon => range or (+/-)boundary  
##        Increment => how much the guesses to be incremented.
##   *Integers are used as a guess in (guess and check).
##   *Floating numbers are used in approximation algorithm
