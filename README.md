## MIT OCW Python:

### About This Repository

* This repository contains my Python practice code and notes created while learning from MIT OpenCourseWare – Introduction to Computer Science and Programming.

* I am learning Python by following the MIT OCW video lectures taught by Prof. AnaBell, and I practice every concept by:

     -Writing the lecture code on my own.

     -Organizing the code topic-wise.

     -Explaining each topic in simple words using README files.


* This repository is purely for learning and practice purposes.


### Purpose of This Repository

-The main goals of this repository are:
* To build strong fundamentals in Python.
* To practice coding by re-implementing lecture examples.
* To document my learning in a structured and understandable way.
* To track my learning progress over time.
* To create a solid base for future topics like Data Structures, Algorithms, and Machine Learning.


### How to Use This Repository

* Navigate to any topic folder.
* Open the .py file(s) to see the practice code.
* Run the code and modify it to your needs.


### Disclaimer

This repository does not contain official MIT course materials,

* All code is written by me for learning purposes.
* The structure and examples are inspired by MIT OpenCourseWare lectures.
* This repository is not affiliated with MIT.
