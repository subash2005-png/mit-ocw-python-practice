## Objects in Python:
* Objects are the data which are manipulated by programs for computation.
* Objects have type which defines what kind of operations or computations can be done with these objects.
* Example of objects - int,float,bool,strings,lists,etc.
* type() is a function used to retrieve the type of the object.

## Variables in Python:
* Variables are the containers that hold the objects.
* "=" is an assignment operator used to assign the object to the variable.
* Required objects can be used by invoking the variable assigned to it.
* one variable name should be assigned to one object (not multiple objects).
* eg: a=5, where a is the variable and 5 is the object.

### Expressions:
* The combination of operators and objects are known as expressions.
* syntax for simple expression:(object)(operator)(object).
* Operators used in python: + , - , * , / , // , % , **, etc.
* varibles can also be assigned to expressions. eg: a=5*2.
